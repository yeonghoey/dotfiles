# topical dotfiles with oh-my-zsh

forked [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

[holman](https://github.com/holman)'s way of organizing, which he named it as **topical**, is great.  

He wrote manys things like `completion`, `prompt`, .., by himself.  
This provides lots of controllability, but can be burdensome.

So I decided to fuse [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).  

Thanks to both great works,  
I can keep my settings modular without writing a lot of shell features by myself.
